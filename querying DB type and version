Querying the database type and version
Different databases provide different ways of querying their version. You often need to try out different queries to find one that works, allowing you to determine both the type and version of the database software.

The queries to determine the database version for some popular database types are as follows:

      Database type	Query
      Microsoft, MySQL	SELECT @@version
      Oracle	SELECT * FROM v$version
      PostgreSQL	SELECT version()
